      <description>In Hugo, pages are the core of your site. Once it is configure, pages are definitely the added value to your documentation site.
Folders Organize your site like any other Hugo project. Typically, you will have a content folder with all your pages.

      <description>Hugo-theme-learn is a theme for Hugo, a fast and modern static website engine written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this theme is fully designed for technical documentation.
This theme is a partial porting of the Learn theme of Grav, a modern flat-file CMS written in PHP.
This current documentation has been statically generated with Hugo with a simple command : hugo -t hugo-theme-learn</description>

      <description>This page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes&amp;hellip;)
 Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.
Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.
But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it&amp;rsquo;s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.
To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a page.</description>
